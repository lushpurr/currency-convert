# CurrencyConverter

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.3 but after generation version was updated to 17.3.17 for access to the more modern standalone component set up. 

This uses https://currencybeacon.com/ API for list of currencies and for handling the conversion. I have deployed my own API on Vercel to make these API calls to ensure security of API key. 

I have added another API call in Vercel to allow users to save a favourite conversion which store it in Azure CosmosDB.

To run project:

Clone git repository

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
